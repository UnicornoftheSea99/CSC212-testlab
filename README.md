# CSC212-testlab
Testing a Singly-Linked List. Objectives: understand how to develop data structures (with tests), get some exposure to JUnit testing, practice and develop our understanding of singly-linked lists.

## Challenges

Check out the code and open all the files:

 - ``src/main/java/*/Node.java``
 - ``src/main/java/*/SList.java``
 - ``src/test/java/*/SListTest.java``
 
Right now, not all of the tests pass. Start with the first test, ``testLength()``. Figure out how to run it. Does it pass? What method is it testing? Does that method work?

One of the challenges of this lab is to read the code and figure out what's going on. There are less hints in this README than usual.

There are small bugs in many of the existing methods on SList. It is possible, but unlikely that there are bugs in the tests.

As a challenge, ``removeFromBack`` is defined but not implemented. Once you've fixed all the other bugs in the SList implementation, you will be ready to work on this method.
